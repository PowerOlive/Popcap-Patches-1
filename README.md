## Download
Please visit [Releases](https://github.com/the1812/Popcap-Patches/releases) page.

## Usage

### Make patch file
- Open `PopcapPatches.exe`
- Backup original game `exe` file
- Click `Open file` to select the game file
- Click `Patch` to get a patched file
- Replace original game file with patched file

### Clean up registry
- Open Windows Registry Editor, navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PopCap\<Game Name>`
- Remove `Test3D` key

### Modify config
- Backup `compat.cfg` in game folder (if there is, or you can skip this step)
- Open it with any text editor
- Find all functions about 3D and resolution, like `Is3DSupported`, `Is3DRecommended`, `IsHighResSupported` or `IsUltraResSupported`
- Let them just `return true`

Example:
```
function(bool) Is3DSupported
{
	if ((compat_D3DVendorID == VENDOR_SIS) || (compat_D3DVendorID == VENDOR_MATROX))
	{
		log("Returning Is3DSupported false due to SIS or Matrox hardware");
		return false;
	}

	// Nowadays any other hardware within our minspec range should be okay for 3D
	return true;
}
```
will become:
```
function(bool) Is3DSupported
{
	return true;
}
```
- Finally save the config file and run game
